      "[ The Tragedie of Macbeth by William Shakespeare 1603 ] Actus Primus . Scoena Prima . Thunder and Lightning . Enter three Witches . 1 . When shall we three meet againe ? In Thunder , Lightning , or in Raine ? 2 . When the Hurley - burley ' s done , When the Battaile ' s lost , and wonne 3 . That will be ere the set of Sunne 1 . Where the place ? 2 . Vpon the Heath 3 . There to meet with Macbeth 1 . I come , Gray - Malkin All . Padock calls anon : faire is foule , and foule is faire , Houer through the fogge and filthie ayre . Exeunt . Scena Secunda . Alarum within . Enter King Malcome , Donalbaine , Lenox , with attendants , meeting a bleeding Captaine . King . What bloody man is that ? he can report , As seemeth by his plight , of the Reuolt The newest state Mal . This is the Serieant , Who like a good and hardie Souldier fought ' Gainst my Captiuitie : Haile braue friend ; Say to the King , the knowledge of the Broyle , As thou didst leaue it Cap . Doubtfull it stood , As two spent Swimmers , that doe cling together , And choake their Art : The mercilesse Macdonwald ( Worthie to be a Rebell , for to that The multiplying Villanies of Nature Doe swarme vpon him ) from the Westerne Isles Of Kernes and Gallowgrosses is supply ' d , And Fortune on his damned Quarry smiling , Shew ' d like a Rebells Whore : but all ' s too weake : For braue Macbeth ( well hee deserues that Name ) Disdayning Fortune , with his brandisht Steele , Which smoak ' d with bloody execution ( Like Valours Minion ) caru ' d out his passage , Till hee fac ' d the Slaue : Which neu ' r shooke hands , nor bad farwell to him , Till he vnseam ' d him from the Naue toth ' Chops , And fix ' d his Head vpon our Battlements King . O valiant Cousin , worthy Gentleman Cap . As whence the Sunne ' gins his reflection , Shipwracking Stormes , and direfull Thunders : So from that Spring , whence comfort seem ' d to come , Discomfort swells : Marke King of Scotland , marke , No sooner Iustice had , with Valour arm ' d , Compell ' d these skipping Kernes to trust their heeles , But the Norweyan Lord , surueying vantage , With furbusht Armes , and new supplyes of men , Began a fresh assault King . Dismay ' d not this our Captaines , Macbeth and Banquoh ? Cap . Yes , as Sparrowes , Eagles ; Or the Hare , the Lyon : If I say sooth , I must report they were As Cannons ouer - charg ' d with double Cracks , So they doubly redoubled stroakes vpon the Foe : Except they meant to bathe in reeking Wounds , Or memorize another Golgotha , I cannot tell : but I am faint , My Gashes cry for helpe King . So well thy words become thee , as thy wounds , They smack of Honor both : Goe get him Surgeons . Enter Rosse and Angus . Who comes here ? Mal . The worthy Thane of Rosse Lenox . What a haste lookes through his eyes ? So should he looke , that seemes to speake things strange Rosse . God saue the King King . Whence cam ' st thou , worthy Thane ? Rosse . From Fiffe , great King , Where the Norweyan Banners flowt the Skie , And fanne our people cold . Norway himselfe , with terrible numbers , Assisted by that most disloyall Traytor , The Thane of Cawdor , began a dismall Conflict , Till that Bellona ' s Bridegroome , lapt in proofe , Confronted him with selfe - comparisons , Point against Point , rebellious Arme ' gainst Arme , Curbing his lauish spirit : and to conclude , The Victorie fell on vs King . Great happinesse Rosse . That now Sweno , the Norwayes King , Craues composition : Nor would we deigne him buriall of his men , Till he disbursed , at Saint Colmes ynch , Ten thousand Dollars , to our generall vse King . No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceiue Our Bosome interest : Goe pronounce his present death , And with his former Title greet Macbeth Rosse . Ile see it done King . What he hath lost , Noble Macbeth hath wonne . Exeunt . Scena Tertia . Thunder . Enter the three Witches . 1 . Where hast thou beene , Sister ? 2 . Killing Swine 3 . Sister , where thou ? 1 . A Saylors Wife had Chestnuts in her Lappe , And mouncht , & mouncht , and mouncht : Giue me , quoth I . Aroynt thee , Witch , the rumpe - fed Ronyon cryes . Her Husband ' s to Aleppo gone , Master o ' th ' Tiger : But in a Syue Ile thither sayle , And like a Rat without a tayle , Ile doe , Ile doe , and Ile doe 2 . Ile giue thee a Winde 1 . Th ' art kinde 3 . And I another 1 . I my selfe haue all the other , And the very Ports they blow , All the Quarters that they know , I ' th ' Ship - mans Card . Ile dreyne him drie as Hay : Sleepe shall neyther Night nor Day Hang vpon his Pent - house Lid : He shall liue a man forbid : Wearie Seu ' nights , nine times nine , Shall he dwindle , peake , and pine : Though his Barke cannot be lost , Yet it shall be Tempest - tost . Looke what I haue 2 . Shew me , shew me 1 . Here I haue a Pilots Thumbe , Wrackt , as homeward he did come . Drum within . 3 . A Drumme , a Drumme : Macbeth doth come All . The weyward Sisters , hand in hand , Posters of the Sea and Land , Thus doe goe , about , about , Thrice to thine , and thrice to mine , And thrice againe , to make vp nine . Peace , the Charme ' s wound vp . Enter Macbeth and Banquo . Macb . So foule and faire a day I haue not seene Banquo . How farre is ' t call ' d to Soris ? What are these , So wither ' d , and so wilde in their attyre , That looke not like th ' Inhabitants o ' th ' Earth , And yet are on ' t ? Liue you , or are you aught That man may question ? you seeme to vnderstand me , By each at once her choppie finger laying Vpon her skinnie Lips : you should be Women , And yet your Beards forbid me to interprete That you are so Mac . Speake if you can : what are you ? 1 . All haile Macbeth , haile to thee Thane of Glamis 2 . All haile Macbeth , haile to thee Thane of Cawdor 3 . All haile Macbeth , that shalt be King hereafter Banq . Good Sir , why doe you start , and seeme to feare Things that doe sound so faire ? i ' th ' name of truth Are ye fantasticall , or that indeed Which outwardly ye shew ? My Noble Partner You greet with present Grace , and great prediction Of Noble hauing , and of Royall hope , That he seemes wrapt withall : to me you speake not . If you can looke into the Seedes of Time , And say , which Graine will grow , and which will not , Speake then to me , who neyther begge , nor feare Your fauors , nor your hate 1 . Hayle 2 . Hayle 3 . Hayle 1 . Lesser than Macbeth , and greater 2 . Not so happy , yet much happyer 3 . Thou shalt get Kings , though thou be none : So all haile Macbeth , and Banquo 1 . Banquo , and Macbeth , all haile Macb . Stay you imperfect Speakers , tell me more : By Sinells death , I know I am Thane of Glamis , But how , of Cawdor ? the Thane of Cawdor liues A prosperous Gentleman : And to be King , Stands not within the prospect of beleefe , No more then to be Cawdor . Say from whence You owe this strange Intelligence , or why Vpon this blasted Heath you stop our way With such Prophetique greeting ? Speake , I charge you . Witches vanish . Banq . The Earth hath bubbles , as the Water ha ' s , And these are of them : whither are they vanish ' d ? Macb . Into the Ayre : and what seem ' d corporall , Melted , as breath into the Winde . Would they had stay ' d Banq . Were such things here , as we doe speake about ? Or haue we eaten on the insane Root , That takes the Reason Prisoner ? Macb . Your Children shall be Kings Banq . You shall be King Macb . And Thane of Cawdor too : went it not so ? Banq . Toth ' selfe - same tune and words : who ' s here ? Enter Rosse and Angus . Rosse . The King hath happily receiu ' d , Macbeth , The newes of thy successe : and when he reades Thy personall Venture in the Rebels sight , His Wonders and his Prayses doe contend , Which should be thine , or his : silenc ' d with that , In viewing o ' re the rest o ' th ' selfe - same day , He findes thee in the stout Norweyan Rankes , Nothing afeard of what thy selfe didst make Strange Images of death , as thick as Tale Can post with post , and euery one did beare Thy prayses in his Kingdomes great defence , And powr ' d them downe before him Ang . Wee are sent , To giue thee from our Royall Master thanks , Onely to harrold thee into his sight , Not pay thee Rosse . And for an earnest of a greater Honor , He bad me , from him , call thee Thane of Cawdor : In which addition , haile most worthy Thane , For it is thine Banq . What , can the Deuill speake true ? Macb . The Thane of Cawdor liues : Why doe you dresse me in borrowed Robes ? Ang . Who was the Thane , liues yet , But vnder heauie Iudgement beares that Life , Which he deserues to loose . Whether he was combin ' d with those of Norway , Or did lyne the Rebell with hidden helpe , And vantage ; or that with both he labour ' d In his Countreyes wracke , I know not : But Treasons Capitall , confess ' d , and prou ' d , Haue ouerthrowne him Macb . Glamys , and Thane of Cawdor : The greatest is behinde . Thankes for your paines . Doe you not hope your Children shall be Kings , When those that gaue the Thane of Cawdor to me , Promis ' d no lesse to them Banq . That trusted home , Might yet enkindle you vnto the Crowne , Besides the Thane of Cawdor . But ' tis strange : And oftentimes , to winne vs to our harme , The Instruments of Darknesse tell vs Truths , Winne vs with honest Trifles , to betray ' s In deepest consequence . Cousins , a word , I pray you Macb . Two Truths are told , As happy Prologues to the swelling Act Of the Imperiall Theame . I thanke you Gentlemen : This supernaturall solliciting Cannot be ill ; cannot be good . If ill ? why hath it giuen me earnest of successe , Commencing in a Truth ? I am Thane of Cawdor . If good ? why doe I yeeld to that suggestion , Whose horrid Image doth vnfixe my Heire , And make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes , Against the vse of Nature ? Present Feares Are lesse then horrible Imaginings : My Thought ,"

Starres hide your fires , Let not Light see my black and deepe desires : The Eye winke at the Hand : yet let that bee , Which the Eye feares , when it is done to see . Enter . King . True worthy Banquo : he is full so valiant , And in his commendations , I am fed : It is a Banquet to me .

They met me in the day of successe : and I haue learn ' d by the perfect ' st report , they haue more in them , then mortall knowledge . When I burnt in desire to question them further , they made themselues Ayre , into which they vanish ' d . Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it , came Missiues from the King , who all - hail ' d me Thane of Cawdor , by which Title before , these weyward Sisters saluted me , and referr ' d me to the comming on of time , with haile King that shalt be . This haue I thought good to deliuer thee ( my dearest Partner of Greatnesse ) that thou might ' st not loose the dues of reioycing by being ignorant of what Greatnesse is promis ' d thee . Lay it to thy heart and farewell . Glamys thou art , and Cawdor , and shalt be What thou art promis ' d : yet doe I feare thy Nature , It is too full o ' th ' Milke of humane kindnesse , To catch the neerest way . Thou would ' st be great , Art not without Ambition , but without The illnesse should attend it . What thou would ' st highly , That would ' st thou holily : would ' st not play false , And yet would ' st wrongly winne . Thould ' st haue , great Glamys , that which cryes , Thus thou must doe , if thou haue it ; And that which rather thou do ' st feare to doe , Then wishest should be vndone . High thee hither , That I may powre my Spirits in thine Eare , And chastise with the valour of my Tongue All that impeides thee from the Golden Round , Which Fate and Metaphysicall ayde doth seeme To haue thee crown ' d withall . Enter Messenger . What is your tidings ? Mess . The King comes here to Night Lady . Thou ' rt mad to say it . Is not thy Master with him ? who , wer ' t so , Would haue inform ' d for preparation Mess . So please you , it is true : our Thane is comming : One of my fellowes had the speed of him ; Who almost dead for breath , had scarcely more Then would make vp his Message Lady . Giue him tending , He brings great newes , Exit Messenger . The Rauen himselfe is hoarse , That croakes the fatall entrance of Duncan Vnder my Battlements . Come you Spirits , That tend on mortall thoughts , vnsex me here , And fill me from the Crowne to the Toe , top - full Of direst Crueltie : make thick my blood , Stop vp th ' accesse , and passage to Remorse , That no compunctious visitings of Nature Shake my fell purpose , nor keepe peace betweene Th ' effect , and hit . Come to my Womans Brests , And take my Milke for Gall , you murth ' ring Ministers , Where - euer , in your sightlesse substances , You wait on Natures Mischiefe . Come thick Night , And pall thee in the dunnest smoake of Hell , That my keene Knife see not the Wound it makes , Nor Heauen peepe through the Blanket of the darke , To cry , hold , hold . Enter Macbeth . Great Glamys , worthy Cawdor , Greater then both , by the all - haile hereafter , Thy Letters haue transported me beyond This ignorant present , and I feele now The future in the instant Macb . My dearest Loue , Duncan comes here to Night Lady . And when goes hence ? Macb . To morrow , as he purposes Lady . O neuer , Shall Sunne that Morrow see . Your Face , my Thane , is as a Booke , where men May reade strange matters , to beguile the time . Looke like the time , beare welcome in your Eye , Your Hand , your Tongue : looke like th ' innocent flower , But be the Serpent vnder ' t . He that ' s comming , Must be prouided for : and you shall put This Nights great Businesse into my dispatch , Which shall to all our Nights , and Dayes to come , Giue solely soueraigne sway , and Masterdome Macb . We will speake further , Lady . Onely looke vp cleare : To alter fauor , euer is to feare : Leaue all the rest to me . Exeunt . Scena Sexta . Hoboyes , and Torches .

This Castle hath a pleasant seat , The ayre nimbly and sweetly recommends it selfe Vnto our gentle sences Banq . This Guest of Summer , The Temple - haunting Barlet does approue , By his loued Mansonry , that the Heauens breath Smells wooingly here : no Iutty frieze , Buttrice , nor Coigne of Vantage , but this Bird Hath made his pendant Bed , and procreant Cradle , Where they must breed , and haunt : I haue obseru ' d The ayre is delicate . Enter Lady . King . See , see our honor ' d Hostesse : The Loue that followes vs , sometime is our trouble , Which still we thanke as Loue . Herein I teach you , How you shall bid God - eyld vs for your paines , And thanke vs for your trouble Lady . All our seruice , In euery point twice done , and then done double , Were poore , and single Businesse , to contend Against those Honors deepe , and broad , Wherewith your Maiestie loades our House : For those of old , and the late Dignities , Heap ' d vp to them , we rest your Ermites King . Where ' s the Thane of Cawdor ? We courst him at the heeles , and had a purpose To be his Purueyor : But he rides well , And his great Loue ( sharpe as his Spurre ) hath holp him To his home before vs : Faire and Noble Hostesse We are your guest to night La . Your Seruants euer , Haue theirs , themselues , and what is theirs in compt , To make their Audit at your Highnesse pleasure , Still to returne your owne King . Giue me your hand : Conduct me to mine Host we loue him highly"

Enter a Sewer , and diuers Seruants with Dishes and Seruice ouer the Stage . Then enter Macbeth Macb . If it were done , when ' tis done , then ' twer well , It were done quickly : If th ' Assassination Could trammell vp the Consequence , and catch With his surcease , Successe : that but this blow Might be the be all , and the end all . Heere , But heere , vpon this Banke and Schoole of time , Wee ' ld iumpe the life to come . But in these Cases , We still haue iudgement heere , that we but teach Bloody Instructions , which being taught , returne To plague th ' Inuenter , this euen - handed Iustice Commends th ' Ingredience of our poyson ' d Challice To our owne lips . Hee ' s heere in double trust ; First , as I am his Kinsman , and his Subiect , Strong both against the Deed : Then , as his Host , Who should against his Murtherer shut the doore , Not beare the knife my selfe . Besides , this Duncane Hath borne his Faculties so meeke ; hath bin So cleere in his great Office , that his Vertues Will pleade like Angels , Trumpet - tongu ' d against The deepe damnation of his taking off : And Pitty , like a naked New - borne - Babe , Striding the blast , or Heauens Cherubin , hors ' d Vpon the sightlesse Curriors of the Ayre , Shall blow the horrid deed in euery eye , That teares shall drowne the winde .

He has almost supt : why haue you left the chamber ? Mac . Hath he ask ' d for me ? La . Know you not , he ha ' s ? Mac . We will proceed no further in this Businesse : He hath Honour ' d me of late , and I haue bought Golden Opinions from all sorts of people , Which would be worne now in their newest glosse , Not cast aside so soone La . Was the hope drunke , Wherein you drest your selfe ? Hath it slept since ? And wakes it now to looke so greene , and pale , At what it did so freely ? From this time , Such I account thy loue . Art thou affear ' d To be the same in thine owne Act , and Valour , As thou art in desire ? Would ' st thou haue that Which thou esteem ' st the Ornament of Life , And liue a Coward in thine owne Esteeme ? Letting I dare not , wait vpon I would , Like the poore Cat i ' th ' Addage Macb . Prythee peace : I dare do all that may become a man , Who dares do more , is none La . What Beast was ' t then That made you breake this enterprize to me ? When you durst do it , then you were a man : And to be more then what you were , you would Be so much more the man . Nor time , nor place Did then adhere , and yet you would make both : They haue made themselues , and that their fitnesse now Do ' s vnmake you . I haue giuen Sucke , and know How tender ' tis to loue the Babe that milkes me , I would , while it was smyling in my Face , Haue pluckt my Nipple from his Bonelesse Gummes , And dasht the Braines out , had I so sworne As you haue done to this Macb . If we should faile ? Lady . We faile ? But screw your courage to the sticking place , And wee ' le not fayle : when Duncan is asleepe , ( Whereto the rather shall his dayes hard Iourney Soundly inuite him ) his two Chamberlaines Will I with Wine , and Wassell , so conuince , That Memorie , the Warder of the Braine , Shall be a Fume , and the Receit of Reason A Lymbeck onely : when in Swinish sleepe , Their drenched Natures lyes as in a Death , What cannot you and I performe vpon Th ' vnguarded Duncan ? What not put vpon His spungie Officers ? who shall beare the guilt Of our great quell Macb . Bring forth Men - Children onely : For thy vndaunted Mettle should compose Nothing but Males .

Enter Macbeth , and a Seruant with a Torch . Giue me my Sword : who ' s there ? Macb . A Friend Banq . What Sir , not yet at rest ? the King ' s a bed . He hath beene in vnusuall Pleasure , And sent forth great Largesse to your Offices . This Diamond he greetes your Wife withall , By the name of most kind Hostesse , And shut vp in measurelesse content Mac . Being vnprepar ' d , Our will became the seruant to defect , Which else should free haue wrought Banq . All ' s well . I dreamt last Night of the three weyward Sisters : To you they haue shew ' d some truth Macb .

I see thee yet , in forme as palpable , As this which now I draw . Thou marshall ' st me the way that I was going , And such an Instrument I was to vse . Mine Eyes are made the fooles o ' th ' other Sences , Or else worth all the rest : I see thee still ; And on thy Blade , and Dudgeon , Gouts of Blood , Which was not so before . There ' s no such thing : It is the bloody Businesse , which informes Thus to mine Eyes . Now o ' re the one halfe World Nature seemes dead , and wicked Dreames abuse The Curtain ' d sleepe : Witchcraft celebrates Pale Heccats Offrings : and wither ' d Murther , Alarum ' d by his Centinell , the Wolfe , Whose howle ' s his Watch , thus with his stealthy pace , With Tarquins rauishing sides , towards his designe Moues like a Ghost . Thou sowre and firme - set Earth Heare not my steps , which they may walke , for feare Thy very stones prate of my where - about , And take the present horror from the time , Which now sutes with it . Whiles I threat , he liues : Words to the heat of deedes too cold breath giues . A Bell rings . I goe , and it is done : the Bell inuites me . Heare it not , Duncan , for it is a Knell , That summons thee to Heauen , or to Hell . Enter . Scena Secunda . Enter Lady . La .

Marry , Sir , Nose - painting , Sleepe , and Vrine . Lecherie , Sir , it prouokes , and vnprouokes : it prouokes the desire , but it takes away the performance . Therefore much Drinke may be said to be an Equiuocator with Lecherie : it makes him , and it marres him ; it sets him on , and it takes him off ; it perswades him , and dis - heartens him ; makes him stand too , and not stand too : in conclusion , equiuocates him in a sleepe , and giuing him the Lye , leaues him Macd .

Let euery man be master of his time , Till seuen at Night , to make societie The sweeter welcome : We will keepe our selfe till Supper time alone : While then , God be with you . Exeunt . Lords .

To be thus , is nothing , but to be safely thus Our feares in Banquo sticke deepe , And in his Royaltie of Nature reignes that Which would be fear ' d . ' Tis much he dares , And to that dauntlesse temper of his Minde , He hath a Wisdome , that doth guide his Valour , To act in safetie . There is none but he , Whose being I doe feare : and vnder him , My Genius is rebuk ' d , as it is said Mark Anthonies was by Caesar . He chid the Sisters , When first they put the Name of King vpon me , And bad them speake to him . Then Prophet - like , They hayl ' d him Father to a Line of Kings . Vpon my Head they plac ' d a fruitlesse Crowne , And put a barren Scepter in my Gripe , Thence to be wrencht with an vnlineall Hand , No Sonne of mine succeeding : if ' t be so , For Banquo ' s Issue haue I fil ' d my Minde , For them , the gracious Duncan haue I murther ' d , Put Rancours in the Vessell of my Peace Onely for them , and mine eternall Iewell Giuen to the common Enemie of Man , To make them Kings , the Seedes of Banquo Kings . Rather then so , come Fate into the Lyst , And champion me to th ' vtterance . Who ' s there ? Enter Seruant , and two Murtherers . Now goe to the Doore , and stay there till we call . Exit Seruant . Was it not yesterday we spoke together ? Murth . It was , so please your Highnesse Macb . Well then , Now haue you consider ' d of my speeches : Know , that it was he , in the times past , Which held you so vnder fortune , Which you thought had been our innocent selfe . This I made good to you , in our last conference , Past in probation with you : How you were borne in hand , how crost : The Instruments : who wrought with them : And all things else , that might To halfe a Soule , and to a Notion craz ' d , Say , Thus did Banquo 1 . Murth . You made it knowne to vs Macb . I did so : And went further , which is now Our point of second meeting . Doe you finde your patience so predominant , In your nature , that you can let this goe ? Are you so Gospell ' d , to pray for this good man , And for his Issue , whose heauie hand Hath bow ' d you to the Graue , and begger ' d Yours for euer ? 1 . Murth . We are men , my Liege Macb .

Now , if you haue a station in the file , Not i ' th ' worst ranke of Manhood , say ' t , And I will put that Businesse in your Bosomes , Whose execution takes your Enemie off , Grapples you to the heart ; and loue of vs , Who weare our Health but sickly in his Life , Which in his Death were perfect 2 . Murth . I am one , my Liege , Whom the vile Blowes and Buffets of the World Hath so incens ' d , that I am recklesse what I doe , To spight the World 1 . Murth . And I another , So wearie with Disasters , tugg ' d with Fortune , That I would set my Life on any Chance , To mend it , or be rid on ' t Macb . Both of you know Banquo was your Enemie Murth . True , my Lord Macb . So is he mine : and in such bloody distance , That euery minute of his being , thrusts Against my neer ' st of Life : and though I could With bare - fac ' d power sweepe him from my sight , And bid my will auouch it ; yet I must not , For certaine friends that are both his , and mine , Whose loues I may not drop , but wayle his fall , Who I my selfe struck downe : and thence it is , That I to your assistance doe make loue , Masking the Businesse from the common Eye , For sundry weightie Reasons 2 . Murth . We shall , my Lord , Performe what you command vs 1 . Murth . Though our Liues - Macb . Your Spirits shine through you . Within this houre , at most , I will aduise you where to plant your selues , Acquaint you with the perfect Spy o ' th ' time , The moment on ' t , for ' t must be done to Night , And something from the Pallace : alwayes thought , That I require a clearenesse ; and with him , To leaue no Rubs nor Botches in the Worke : Fleans , his Sonne , that keepes him companie , Whose absence is no lesse materiall to me , Then is his Fathers , must embrace the fate Of that darke houre : resolue your selues apart , Ile come to you anon Murth . We are resolu ' d , my Lord Macb . Ile call vpon you straight : abide within , It is concluded : Banquo , thy Soules flight , If it finde Heauen , must finde it out to Night . Exeunt . Scena Secunda . Enter Macbeths Lady , and a Seruant . Lady . Is Banquo gone from Court ? Seruant . I , Madame , but returnes againe to Night Lady . Say to the King , I would attend his leysure , For a few words Seruant . Madame , I will . Enter . Lady . Nought ' s had , all ' s spent . Where our desire is got without content : ' Tis safer , to be that which we destroy , Then by destruction dwell in doubtfull ioy . Enter Macbeth . How now , my Lord , why doe you keepe alone ? Of sorryest Fancies your Companions making , Vsing those Thoughts , which should indeed haue dy ' d With them they thinke on : things without all remedie Should be without regard : what ' s done , is done Macb .

More shall they speake : for now I am bent to know By the worst meanes , the worst , for mine owne good , All causes shall giue way .

The gracious Duncan Was pittied of Macbeth : marry he was dead : And the right valiant Banquo walk ' d too late , Whom you may say ( if ' t please you ) Fleans kill ' d , For Fleans fled : Men must not walke too late . Who cannot want the thought , how monstrous It was for Malcolme , and for Donalbane To kill their gracious Father ? Damned Fact , How it did greeue Macbeth ? Did he not straight In pious rage , the two delinquents teare , That were the Slaues of drinke , and thralles of sleepe ? Was not that Nobly done ? I , and wisely too : For ' twould haue anger ' d any heart aliue To heare the men deny ' t . So that I say , He ha ' s borne all things well , and I do thinke , That had he Duncans Sonnes vnder his Key , ( As , and ' t please Heauen he shall not ) they should finde What ' twere to kill a Father : So should Fleans . But peace ; for from broad words , and cause he fayl ' d His presence at the Tyrants Feast , I heare Macduffe liues in disgrace . Sir , can you tell Where he bestowes himselfe ? Lord .

I take my leaue of you : Shall not be long but Ile be heere againe : Things at the worst will cease , or else climbe vpward , To what they were before . My pretty Cosine , Blessing vpon you Wife . Father ' d he is , And yet hee ' s Father - lesse Rosse . I am so much a Foole , should I stay longer It would be my disgrace , and your discomfort . I take my leaue at once . Exit Rosse . Wife . Sirra , your Fathers dead , And what will you do now ? How will you liue ? Son . As Birds do Mother Wife . What with Wormes , and Flyes ? Son . With what I get I meane , and so do they Wife . Poore Bird , Thou ' dst neuer Feare the Net , nor Lime , The Pitfall , nor the Gin Son . Why should I Mother ? Poore Birds they are not set for : My Father is not dead for all your saying Wife . Yes , he is dead : How wilt thou do for a Father ? Son . Nay how will you do for a Husband ? Wife . Why I can buy me twenty at any Market Son . Then you ' l by ' em to sell againe Wife . Thou speak ' st withall thy wit , And yet I ' faith with wit enough for thee Son . Was my Father a Traitor , Mother ? Wife . I , that he was Son . What is a Traitor ? Wife . Why one that sweares , and lyes Son . And be all Traitors , that do so Wife . Euery one that do ' s so , is a Traitor , And must be hang ' d Son . And must they all be hang ' d , that swear and lye ? Wife . Euery one Son . Who must hang them ? Wife . Why , the honest men Son . Then the Liars and Swearers are Fools : for there are Lyars and Swearers enow , to beate the honest men , and hang vp them Wife . Now God helpe thee , poore Monkie : But how wilt thou do for a Father ? Son . If he were dead , youl ' d weepe for him : if you would not , it were a good signe , that I should quickely haue a new Father Wife . Poore pratler , how thou talk ' st ? Enter a Messenger . Mes . Blesse you faire Dame : I am not to you known , Though in your state of Honor I am perfect ; I doubt some danger do ' s approach you neerely . If you will take a homely mans aduice , Be not found heere : Hence with your little ones To fright you thus . Me thinkes I am too sauage : To do worse to you , were fell Cruelty , Which is too nie your person . Heauen preserue you , I dare abide no longer . Exit Messenger Wife . Whether should I flye ? I haue done no harme . But I remember now I am in this earthly world : where to do harme Is often laudable , to do good sometime Accounted dangerous folly . Why then ( alas ) Do I put vp that womanly defence , To say I haue done no harme ? What are these faces ? Enter Murtherers . Mur . Where is your Husband ? Wife . I hope in no place so vnsanctified , Where such as thou may ' st finde him Mur . He ' s a Traitor Son . Thou ly ' st thou shagge - ear ' d Villaine Mur . What you Egge ? Yong fry of Treachery ? Son . He ha ' s kill ' d me Mother , Run away I pray you . Exit crying Murther . Scaena Tertia . Enter Malcolme and Macduffe . Mal . Let vs seeke out some desolate shade , & there Weepe our sad bosomes empty Macd . Let vs rather Hold fast the mortall Sword : and like good men , Bestride our downfall Birthdome : each new Morne , New Widdowes howle , new Orphans cry , new sorowes Strike heauen on the face , that it resounds As if it felt with Scotland , and yell ' d out Like Syllable of Dolour Mal . What I beleeue , Ile waile ; What know , beleeue ; and what I can redresse , As I shall finde the time to friend : I wil . What you haue spoke , it may be so perchance . This Tyrant , whose sole name blisters our tongues , Was once thought honest : you haue lou ' d him well , He hath not touch ' d you yet . I am yong , but something You may discerne of him through me , and wisedome To offer vp a weake , poore innocent Lambe T ' appease an angry God Macd . I am not treacherous Malc . But Macbeth is . A good and vertuous Nature may recoyle In an Imperiall charge . But I shall craue your pardon : That which you are , my thoughts cannot transpose ; Angels are bright still , though the brightest fell . Though all things foule , would wear the brows of grace Yet Grace must still looke so Macd . I haue lost my Hopes Malc . Perchance euen there Where I did finde my doubts . Why in that rawnesse left you Wife , and Childe ? Those precious Motiues , those strong knots of Loue , Without leaue - taking . I pray you , Let not my Iealousies , be your Dishonors , But mine owne Safeties : you may be rightly iust , What euer I shall thinke Macd . Bleed , bleed poore Country , Great Tyrrany , lay thou thy basis sure , For goodnesse dare not check thee : wear y thy wrongs , The Title , is affear ' d . Far thee well Lord , I would not be the Villaine that thou think ' st , For the whole Space that ' s in the Tyrants Graspe , And the rich East to boot Mal . Be not offended : I speake not as in absolute feare of you : I thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake , It weepes , it bleeds , and each new day a gash Is added to her wounds . I thinke withall , There would be hands vplifted in my right : And heere from gracious England haue I offer Of goodly thousands . But for all this , When I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head , Or weare it on my Sword ; yet my poore Country Shall haue more vices then it had before , More suffer , and more sundry wayes then euer , By him that shall succeede Macd . What should he be ? Mal . It is my selfe I meane : in whom I know All the particulars of Vice so grafted , That when they shall be open ' d , blacke Macbeth Will seeme as pure as Snow , and the poore State Esteeme him as a Lambe , being compar ' d With my confinelesse harmes Macd . Not in the Legions Of horrid Hell , can come a Diuell more damn ' d In euils , to top Macbeth Mal . I grant him Bloody , Luxurious , Auaricious , False , Deceitfull , Sodaine , Malicious , smacking of euery sinne That ha ' s a name . But there ' s no bottome , none In my Voluptuousnesse : Your Wiues , your Daughters , Your Matrons , and your Maides , could not fill vp The Cesterne of my Lust , and my Desire All continent Impediments would ore - beare That did oppose my will . Better Macbeth , Then such an one to reigne Macd . Boundlesse intemperance In Nature is a Tyranny : It hath beene Th ' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne , And fall of many Kings . But feare not yet To take vpon you what is yours : you may Conuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty , And yet seeme cold . The time you may so hoodwinke : We haue willing Dames enough : there cannot be That Vulture in you , to deuoure so many As will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues , Finding it so inclinde Mal . With this , there growes In my most ill - composd Affection , such A stanchlesse Auarice , that were I King , I should cut off the Nobles for their Lands , Desire his Iewels , and this others House , And my more - hauing , would be as a Sawce To make me hunger more , that I should forge Quarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall , Destroying them for wealth Macd . This Auarice stickes deeper : growes with more pernicious roote Then Summer - seeming Lust : and it hath bin The Sword of our slaine Kings : yet do not feare , Scotland hath Foysons , to fill vp your will Of your meere Owne . All these are portable , With other Graces weigh ' d Mal . But I haue none . The King - becoming Graces , As Iustice , Verity , Temp ' rance , Stablenesse , Bounty , Perseuerance , Mercy , Lowlinesse , Deuotion , Patience , Courage , Fortitude , I haue no rellish of them , but abound In the diuision of each seuerall Crime , Acting it many wayes . Nay , had I powre , I should Poure the sweet Milke of Concord , into Hell , Vprore the vniuersall peace , confound All vnity on earth Macd . O Scotland , Scotland Mal . If such a one be fit to gouerne , speake : I am as I haue spoken Mac . Fit to gouern ? No not to liue . O Natio [ n ] miserable ! With an vntitled Tyrant , bloody Sceptred , When shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe ? Since that the truest Issue of thy Throne By his owne Interdiction stands accust , And do ' s blaspheme his breed ? Thy Royall Father Was a most Sainted - King : the Queene that bore thee , Oftner vpon her knees , then on her feet , Dy ' de euery day she liu ' d .

      " from Scotland . O my Brest , Thy hope ends heere Mal . Macduff , this Noble passion Childe of integrity , hath from my soule Wip ' d the blacke Scruples , reconcil ' d my thoughts To thy good Truth , and Honor . Diuellish Macbeth , By many of these traines , hath sought to win me Into his power : and modest Wisedome pluckes me From ouer - credulous hast : but God aboue Deale betweene thee and me ; For euen now I put my selfe to thy Direction , and Vnspeake mine owne detraction . Heere abiure The taints , and blames I laide vpon my selfe , For strangers to my Nature . I am yet Vnknowne to Woman , neuer was forsworne , Scarsely haue coueted what was mine owne . At no time broke my Faith , would not betray The Deuill to his Fellow , and delight No lesse in truth then life . My first false speaking Was this vpon my selfe . What I am truly Is thine , and my poore Countries to command : Whither indeed , before they heere approach Old Seyward with ten thousand warlike men Already at a point , was setting foorth : Now wee ' l together , and the chance of goodnesse Be like our warranted Quarrell . Why are you silent ? Macd . Such welcome , and vnwelcom things at once ' Tis hard to reconcile . Enter a Doctor . Mal . Well , more anon . Comes the King forth I pray you ? Doct . I Sir : there are a crew of wretched Soules That stay his Cure : their malady conuinces The great assay of Art . But at his touch , Such sanctity hath Heauen giuen his hand , They presently amend . Enter . Mal . I thanke you Doctor Macd . What ' s the Disease he meanes ? Mal . Tis call ' d the Euill . A most myraculous worke in this good King , Which often since my heere remaine in England , I haue seene him do : How he solicites heauen Himselfe best knowes : but strangely visited people All swolne and Vlcerous , pittifull to the eye , The meere dispaire of Surgery , he cures , Hanging a golden stampe about their neckes , Put on with holy Prayers , and ' tis spoken To the succeeding Royalty he leaues The healing Benediction . With this strange vertue , He hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie , And sundry Blessings hang about his Throne , That speake him full of Grace . Enter Rosse . Macd . See who comes heere Malc . My Countryman : but yet I know him not Macd . My euer gentle Cozen , welcome hither Malc . I know him now . Good God betimes remoue The meanes that makes vs Strangers Rosse . Sir , Amen Macd . Stands Scotland where it did ? Rosse . Alas poore Countrey , Almost affraid to know it selfe . It cannot Be call ' d our Mother , but our Graue ; where nothing But who knowes nothing , is once seene to smile : Where sighes , and groanes , and shrieks that rent the ayre Are made , not mark ' d : Where violent sorrow seemes A Moderne extasie : The Deadmans knell , Is there scarse ask ' d for who , and good mens liues Expire before the Flowers in their Caps , Dying , or ere they sicken Macd . Oh Relation ; too nice , and yet too true Malc . What ' s the newest griefe ? Rosse . That of an houres age , doth hisse the speaker , Each minute teemes a new one Macd . How do ' s my Wife ? Rosse . Why well Macd . And all my Children ? Rosse . Well too Macd . The Tyrant ha ' s not batter ' d at their peace ? Rosse . No , they were wel at peace , when I did leaue ' em Macd . Be not a niggard of your speech : How gos ' t ? Rosse . When I came hither to transport the Tydings Which I haue heauily borne , there ran a Rumour Of many worthy Fellowes , that were out , Which was to my beleefe witnest the rather , For that I saw the Tyrants Power a - foot . Now is the time of helpe : your eye in Scotland Would create Soldiours , make our women fight , To doffe their dire distresses Malc . Bee ' t their comfort We are comming thither : Gracious England hath Lent vs good Seyward , and ten thousand men , An older , and a better Souldier , none That Christendome giues out Rosse . Would I could answer This comfort with the like . But I haue words That would be howl ' d out in the desert ayre , Where hearing should not latch them Macd . What concerne they , The generall cause , or is it a Fee - griefe Due to some single brest ? Rosse . No minde that ' s honest But in it shares some woe , though the maine part Pertaines to you alone Macd . If it be mine Keepe it not from me , quickly let me haue it Rosse . Let not your eares dispise my tongue for euer , Which shall possesse them with the heauiest sound that euer yet they heard Macd . Humh : I guesse at it Rosse . Your Castle is surpriz ' d : your Wife , and Babes Sauagely slaughter ' d : To relate the manner Were on the Quarry of these murther ' d Deere To adde the death of you Malc . Mercifull Heauen : What man , ne ' re pull your hat vpon your browes : Giue sorrow words ; the griefe that do ' s not speake , Whispers the o ' re - fraught heart , and bids it breake Macd . My Children too ? Ro . Wife , Children , Seruants , all that could be found Macd . And I must be from thence ? My wife kil ' d too ? Rosse . I haue said Malc . Be comforted . Let ' s make vs Med ' cines of our great Reuenge , To cure this deadly greefe Macd . He ha ' s no Children . All my pretty ones ? Did you say All ? Oh Hell - Kite ! All ? What , All my pretty Chickens , and their Damme At one fell swoope ? Malc . Dispute it like a man Macd . I shall do so : But I must also feele it as a man ; I cannot but remember such things were That were most precious to me : Did heauen looke on , And would not take their part ? Sinfull Macduff , They were all strooke for thee : Naught that I am , Not for their owne demerits , but for mine Fell slaughter on their soules : Heauen rest them now Mal . Be this the Whetstone of your sword , let griefe Conuert to anger : blunt not the heart , enrage it Macd . O I could play the woman with mine eyes , And Braggart with my tongue . But gentle Heauens , Cut short all intermission : Front to Front , Bring thou this Fiend of Scotland , and my selfe Within my Swords length set him , if he scape Heauen forgiue him too Mal . This time goes manly : Come go we to the King , our Power is ready , Our lacke is nothing but our leaue . Macbeth Is ripe for shaking , and the Powres aboue Put on their Instruments : Receiue what cheere you may , The Night is long , that neuer findes the Day . Exeunt . Actus Quintus . Scena Prima .

A great perturbation in Nature , to receyue at once the benefit of sleep , and do the effects of watching . In this slumbry agitation , besides her walking , and other actuall performances , what ( at any time ) haue you heard her say ? Gent . That Sir , which I will not report after her Doct . You may to me , and ' tis most meet you should Gent . Neither to you , nor any one , hauing no witnesse to confirme my speech . Enter Lady , with a Taper .

Fye , my Lord , fie , a Souldier , and affear ' d ? what need we feare ? who knowes it , when none can call our powre to accompt : yet who would haue thought the olde man to haue had so much blood in him Doct . Do you marke that ? Lad . The Thane of Fife , had a wife : where is she now ? What will these hands ne ' re be cleane ? No more o ' that my Lord , no more o ' that : you marre all with this starting Doct . Go too , go too : You haue knowne what you should not Gent . She ha ' s spoke what shee should not , I am sure of that : Heauen knowes what she ha ' s knowne La .

Dispaire thy Charme , And let the Angell whom thou still hast seru ' d Tell thee , Macduffe was from his Mothers womb Vntimely ript Macb . Accursed be that tongue that tels mee so ; For it hath Cow ' d my better part of man : And be these Iugling Fiends no more beleeu ' d , That palter with vs in a double sence , That keepe the word of promise to our eare , And breake it to our hope .

All haile Macbeth, that shalt be King hereafter\\n\\n   Banq. Good Sir, why doe you start, and seeme to feare\\nThings that doe sound so faire? i'th' name of truth\\nAre ye fantasticall, or that indeed\\nWhich outwardly ye shew? My Noble Partner\\nYou greet with present Grace, and great prediction\\nOf Noble hauing, and of Royall hope,\\nThat he seemes wrapt withall: to me you speake not.\\nIf you can looke into the Seedes of Time,\\nAnd say, which Graine will grow, and which will not,\\nSpeake then to me, who neyther begge, nor feare\\nYour fauors, nor your hate\\n\\n   1.

Say from whence\\nYou owe this strange Intelligence, or why\\nVpon this blasted Heath you stop our way\\nWith such Prophetique greeting?\\nSpeake, I charge you.\\n\\nWitches vanish.\\n\\n  Banq. The Earth hath bubbles, as the Water ha's,\\nAnd these are of them: whither are they vanish'd?\\n  Macb. Into the Ayre: and what seem'd corporall,\\nMelted, as breath into the Winde.\\nWould they had stay'd\\n\\n   Banq. Were such things here, as we doe speake about?\\nOr haue we eaten on the insane Root,\\nThat takes the Reason Prisoner?\\n  Macb. Your Children shall be Kings\\n\\n   Banq. You shall be King\\n\\n   Macb. And Thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?\\n  Banq. Toth' selfe-same tune and words: who's here?\\nEnter Rosse and Angus.\\n\\n  Rosse. The King hath happily receiu'd, Macbeth,\\nThe newes of thy successe: and when he reades\\nThy personall Venture in the Rebels sight,\\nHis Wonders and his Prayses doe contend,\\nWhich should be thine, or his: silenc'd with that,\\nIn viewing o're the rest o'th' selfe-same day,\\nHe findes thee in the stout Norweyan Rankes,\\nNothing afeard of what thy selfe didst make\\nStrange Images of death, as thick as Tale\\nCan post with post, and euery one did beare\\nThy prayses in his Kingdomes great defence,\\nAnd powr'd them downe before him\\n\\n   Ang. Wee are sent,\\nTo giue thee from our Royall Master thanks,\\nOnely to harrold thee into his sight,\\nNot pay thee\\n\\n   Rosse.

What, can the Deuill speake true?\\n  Macb. The Thane of Cawdor liues:\\nWhy doe you dresse me in borrowed Robes?\\n  Ang. Who was the Thane, liues yet,\\nBut vnder heauie Iudgement beares that Life,\\nWhich he deserues to loose.\\nWhether he was combin'd with those of Norway,\\nOr did lyne the Rebell with hidden helpe,\\nAnd vantage; or that with both he labour'd\\nIn his Countreyes wracke, I know not:\\nBut Treasons Capitall, confess'd, and prou'd,\\nHaue ouerthrowne him\\n\\n   Macb. Glamys, and Thane of Cawdor:\\nThe greatest is behinde. Thankes for your paines.\\nDoe you not hope your Children shall be Kings,\\nWhen those that gaue the Thane of Cawdor to me,\\nPromis'd no lesse to them\\n\\n   Banq. That trusted home,\\nMight yet enkindle you vnto the Crowne,\\nBesides the Thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:\\nAnd oftentimes, to winne vs to our harme,\\nThe Instruments of Darknesse tell vs Truths,\\nWinne vs with honest Trifles, to betray's\\nIn deepest consequence.\\nCousins, a word, I pray you\\n\\n   Macb. Two Truths are told,\\nAs happy Prologues to the swelling Act\\nOf the Imperiall Theame. I thanke you Gentlemen:\\nThis supernaturall solliciting\\nCannot be ill; cannot be good.\\nIf ill? why hath it giuen me earnest of successe,\\nCommencing in a Truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.\\nIf good? why doe I yeeld to that suggestion,\\nWhose horrid Image doth vnfixe my Heire,\\nAnd make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes,\\nAgainst the vse of Nature? Present Feares\\nAre lesse then horrible Imaginings:\\nMy Thought, whose Murther yet is but fantasticall,\\nShakes so my single state of Man,\\nThat Function is smother'd in surmise,\\nAnd nothing is, but what is not\\n\\n   Banq. Looke how our Partner's rapt\\n\\n   Macb. If Chance will haue me King,\\nWhy Chance may Crowne me,\\nWithout my stirre\\n\\n   Banq. New Honors come vpon him\\nLike our strange Garments, cleaue not to their mould,\\nBut with the aid of vse\\n\\n   Macb. Come what come may,\\nTime, and the Houre, runs through the roughest Day\\n\\n   Banq. Worthy Macbeth, wee stay vpon your leysure\\n\\n   Macb. Giue me your fauour:\\nMy dull Braine was wrought with things forgotten.\\nKinde Gentlemen, your paines are registred,\\nWhere euery day I turne the Leafe,\\nTo reade them.\\nLet vs toward the King: thinke vpon\\nWhat hath chanc'd: and at more time,\\nThe Interim hauing weigh'd it, let vs speake\\nOur free Hearts each to other\\n\\n   Banq.

Is execution done on Cawdor?\\nOr not those in Commission yet return'd?\\n  Mal. My Liege, they are not yet come back.\\nBut I haue spoke with one that saw him die:\\nWho did report, that very frankly hee\\nConfess'd his Treasons, implor'd your Highnesse Pardon,\\nAnd set forth a deepe Repentance:\\nNothing in his Life became him,\\nLike the leauing it. Hee dy'de,\\nAs one that had beene studied in his death,\\nTo throw away the dearest thing he ow'd,\\nAs 'twere a carelesse Trifle\\n\\n   King.

Where's the Thane of Cawdor?\\nWe courst him at the heeles, and had a purpose\\nTo be his Purueyor: But he rides well,\\nAnd his great Loue (sharpe as his Spurre) hath holp him\\nTo his home before vs: Faire and Noble Hostesse\\nWe are your guest to night\\n\\n   La. Your Seruants euer,\\nHaue theirs, themselues, and what is theirs in compt,\\nTo make their Audit at your Highnesse pleasure,\\nStill to returne your owne\\n\\n   King. Giue me your hand:\\nConduct me to mine Host we loue him highly,\\nAnd shall continue, our Graces towards him.\\nBy your leaue Hostesse.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nScena Septima.\\n\\nHoboyes. Torches. Enter a Sewer, and diuers Seruants with Dishes\\nand\\nSeruice ouer the Stage. Then enter Macbeth\\n\\n   Macb. If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twer well,\\nIt were done quickly: If th' Assassination\\nCould trammell vp the Consequence, and catch\\nWith his surcease, Successe: that but this blow\\nMight be the be all, and the end all. Heere,\\nBut heere, vpon this Banke and Schoole of time,\\nWee'ld iumpe the life to come. But in these Cases,\\nWe still haue iudgement heere, that we but teach\\nBloody Instructions, which being taught, returne\\nTo plague th' Inuenter, this euen-handed Iustice\\nCommends th' Ingredience of our poyson'd Challice\\nTo our owne lips. Hee's heere in double trust;\\nFirst, as I am his Kinsman, and his Subiect,\\nStrong both against the Deed: Then, as his Host,\\nWho should against his Murtherer shut the doore,\\nNot beare the knife my selfe. Besides, this Duncane\\nHath borne his Faculties so meeke; hath bin\\nSo cleere in his great Office, that his Vertues\\nWill pleade like Angels, Trumpet-tongu'd against\\nThe deepe damnation of his taking off:\\nAnd Pitty, like a naked New-borne-Babe,\\nStriding the blast, or Heauens Cherubin, hors'd\\nVpon the sightlesse Curriors of the Ayre,\\nShall blow the horrid deed in euery eye,\\nThat teares shall drowne the winde. I haue no Spurre\\nTo pricke the sides of my intent, but onely\\nVaulting Ambition, which ore-leapes it selfe,\\nAnd falles on th' other.\\nEnter Lady.\\n\\nHow now? What Newes?\\n  La. He has almost supt: why haue you left the chamber?\\n  Mac. Hath he ask'd for me?\\n  La. Know you not, he ha's?\\n  Mac. We will proceed no further in this Businesse:\\nHe hath Honour'd me of late, and I haue bought\\nGolden Opinions from all sorts of people,\\nWhich would be worne now in their newest glosse,\\nNot cast aside so soone\\n\\n   La. Was the hope drunke,\\nWherein you drest your selfe? Hath it slept since?\\nAnd wakes it now to looke so greene, and pale,\\nAt what it did so freely? From this time,\\nSuch I account thy loue. Art thou affear'd\\nTo be the same in thine owne Act, and Valour,\\nAs thou art in desire? Would'st thou haue that\\nWhich thou esteem'st the Ornament of Life,\\nAnd liue a Coward in thine owne Esteeme?\\nLetting I dare not, wait vpon I would,\\nLike the poore Cat i'th' Addage\\n\\n   Macb. Prythee peace:\\nI dare do all that may become a man,\\nWho dares do more, is none\\n\\n   La. What Beast was't then\\nThat made you breake this enterprize to me?\\nWhen you durst do it, then you were a man:\\nAnd to be more then what you were, you would\\nBe so much more the man. Nor time, nor place\\nDid then adhere, and yet you would make both:\\nThey haue made themselues, and that their fitnesse now\\nDo's vnmake you. I haue giuen Sucke, and know\\nHow tender 'tis to loue the Babe that milkes me,\\nI would, while it was smyling in my Face,\\nHaue pluckt my Nipple from his Bonelesse Gummes,\\nAnd dasht the Braines out, had I so sworne\\nAs you haue done to this\\n\\n   Macb. If we should faile?\\n  Lady. We faile?\\nBut screw your courage to the sticking place,\\nAnd wee'le not fayle: when Duncan is asleepe,\\n(Whereto the rather shall his dayes hard Iourney\\nSoundly inuite him) his two Chamberlaines\\nWill I with Wine, and Wassell, so conuince,\\nThat Memorie, the Warder of the Braine,\\nShall be a Fume, and the Receit of Reason\\nA Lymbeck onely: when in Swinish sleepe,\\nTheir drenched Natures lyes as in a Death,\\nWhat cannot you and I performe vpon\\nTh' vnguarded Duncan? What not put vpon\\nHis spungie Officers? who shall beare the guilt\\nOf our great quell\\n\\n   Macb. Bring forth Men-Children onely:\\nFor thy vndaunted Mettle should compose\\nNothing but Males. Will it not be receiu'd,\\nWhen we haue mark'd with blood those sleepie two\\nOf his owne Chamber, and vs'd their very Daggers,\\nThat they haue don't?\\n  Lady. Who dares receiue it other,\\nAs we shall make our Griefes and Clamor rore,\\nVpon his Death?\\n  Macb. I am settled, and bend vp\\nEach corporall Agent to this terrible Feat.\\nAway, and mock the time with fairest show,\\nFalse Face must hide what the false Heart doth know.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\n\\nActus Secundus.

Hold, take my Sword:\\nThere's Husbandry in Heauen,\\nTheir Candles are all out: take thee that too.\\nA heauie Summons lyes like Lead vpon me,\\nAnd yet I would not sleepe:\\nMercifull Powers, restraine in me the cursed thoughts\\nThat Nature giues way to in repose.\\nEnter Macbeth, and a Seruant with a Torch.\\n\\nGiue me my Sword: who's there?\\n  Macb. A Friend\\n\\n   Banq. What Sir, not yet at rest? the King's a bed.\\nHe hath beene in vnusuall Pleasure,\\nAnd sent forth great Largesse to your Offices.\\nThis Diamond he greetes your Wife withall,\\nBy the name of most kind Hostesse,\\nAnd shut vp in measurelesse content\\n\\n   Mac. Being vnprepar'd,\\nOur will became the seruant to defect,\\nWhich else should free haue wrought\\n\\n   Banq. All's well.\\nI dreamt last Night of the three weyward Sisters:\\nTo you they haue shew'd some truth\\n\\n   Macb. I thinke not of them:\\nYet when we can entreat an houre to serue,\\nWe would spend it in some words vpon that Businesse,\\nIf you would graunt the time\\n\\n   Banq. At your kind'st leysure\\n\\n   Macb. If you shall cleaue to my consent,\\nWhen 'tis, it shall make Honor for you\\n\\n   Banq. So I lose none,\\nIn seeking to augment it, but still keepe\\nMy Bosome franchis'd, and Allegeance cleare,\\nI shall be counsail'd\\n\\n   Macb. Good repose the while\\n\\n   Banq.

Come, let me clutch thee:\\nI haue thee not, and yet I see thee still.\\nArt thou not fatall Vision, sensible\\nTo feeling, as to sight? or art thou but\\nA Dagger of the Minde, a false Creation,\\nProceeding from the heat-oppressed Braine?\\nI see thee yet, in forme as palpable,\\nAs this which now I draw.\\nThou marshall'st me the way that I was going,\\nAnd such an Instrument I was to vse.\\nMine Eyes are made the fooles o'th' other Sences,\\nOr else worth all the rest: I see thee still;\\nAnd on thy Blade, and Dudgeon, Gouts of Blood,\\nWhich was not so before. There's no such thing:\\nIt is the bloody Businesse, which informes\\nThus to mine Eyes. Now o're the one halfe World\\nNature seemes dead, and wicked Dreames abuse\\nThe Curtain'd sleepe: Witchcraft celebrates\\nPale Heccats Offrings: and wither'd Murther,\\nAlarum'd by his Centinell, the Wolfe,\\nWhose howle's his Watch, thus with his stealthy pace,\\nWith Tarquins rauishing sides, towards his designe\\nMoues like a Ghost. Thou sowre and firme-set Earth\\nHeare not my steps, which they may walke, for feare\\nThy very stones prate of my where-about,\\nAnd take the present horror from the time,\\nWhich now sutes with it. Whiles I threat, he liues:\\nWords to the heat of deedes too cold breath giues.\\n\\nA Bell rings.\\n\\nI goe, and it is done: the Bell inuites me.\\nHeare it not, Duncan, for it is a Knell,\\nThat summons thee to Heauen, or to Hell.\\nEnter.\\n\\n\\nScena Secunda.\\n\\nEnter Lady.\\n\\n  La.

I haue drugg'd their Possets,\\nThat Death and Nature doe contend about them,\\nWhether they liue, or dye.\\nEnter Macbeth.\\n\\n  Macb. Who's there? what hoa?\\n  Lady. Alack, I am afraid they haue awak'd,\\nAnd 'tis not done: th' attempt, and not the deed,\\nConfounds vs: hearke: I lay'd their Daggers ready,\\nHe could not misse 'em. Had he not resembled\\nMy Father as he slept, I had don't.\\nMy Husband?\\n  Macb. I haue done the deed:\\nDidst thou not heare a noyse?\\n  Lady.

Hearke, who lyes i'th' second Chamber?\\n  Lady. Donalbaine\\n\\n   Mac. This is a sorry sight\\n\\n   Lady. A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight\\n\\n   Macb. There's one did laugh in's sleepe,\\nAnd one cry'd Murther, that they did wake each other:\\nI stood, and heard them: But they did say their Prayers,\\nAnd addrest them againe to sleepe\\n\\n   Lady. There are two lodg'd together\\n\\n   Macb. One cry'd God blesse vs, and Amen the other,\\nAs they had seene me with these Hangmans hands:\\nListning their feare, I could not say Amen,\\nWhen they did say God blesse vs\\n\\n   Lady. Consider it not so deepely\\n\\n   Mac. But wherefore could not I pronounce Amen?\\nI had most need of Blessing, and Amen stuck in my throat\\n\\n   Lady. These deeds must not be thought\\nAfter these wayes: so, it will make vs mad\\n\\n   Macb. Me thought I heard a voyce cry, Sleep no more:\\nMacbeth does murther Sleepe, the innocent Sleepe,\\nSleepe that knits vp the rauel'd Sleeue of Care,\\nThe death of each dayes Life, sore Labors Bath,\\nBalme of hurt Mindes, great Natures second Course,\\nChiefe nourisher in Life's Feast\\n\\n   Lady. What doe you meane?\\n  Macb. Still it cry'd, Sleepe no more to all the House:\\nGlamis hath murther'd Sleepe, and therefore Cawdor\\nShall sleepe no more: Macbeth shall sleepe no more\\n\\n   Lady. Who was it, that thus cry'd? why worthy Thane,\\nYou doe vnbend your Noble strength, to thinke\\nSo braine-sickly of things: Goe get some Water,\\nAnd wash this filthie Witnesse from your Hand.\\nWhy did you bring these Daggers from the place?\\nThey must lye there: goe carry them, and smeare\\nThe sleepie Groomes with blood\\n\\n   Macb. Ile goe no more:\\nI am afraid, to thinke what I haue done:\\nLooke on't againe, I dare not\\n\\n   Lady. Infirme of purpose:\\nGiue me the Daggers: the sleeping, and the dead,\\nAre but as Pictures: 'tis the Eye of Childhood,\\nThat feares a painted Deuill.

Whence is that knocking?\\nHow is't with me, when euery noyse appalls me?\\nWhat Hands are here? hah: they pluck out mine Eyes.\\nWill all great Neptunes Ocean wash this blood\\nCleane from my Hand? no: this my Hand will rather\\nThe multitudinous Seas incarnardine,\\nMaking the Greene one, Red.\\nEnter Lady.\\n\\n  Lady.

Here's a Farmer, that hang'd\\nhimselfe on th' expectation of Plentie: Come in time, haue\\nNapkins enow about you, here you'le sweat for't.\\n\\nKnock.\\n\\nKnock, knock.

Marry, Sir, Nose-painting, Sleepe, and Vrine.\\nLecherie, Sir, it prouokes, and vnprouokes: it prouokes\\nthe desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore\\nmuch Drinke may be said to be an Equiuocator with Lecherie:\\nit makes him, and it marres him; it sets him on,\\nand it takes him off; it perswades him, and dis-heartens\\nhim; makes him stand too, and not stand too: in conclusion,\\nequiuocates him in a sleepe, and giuing him the Lye,\\nleaues him\\n\\n   Macd. I beleeue, Drinke gaue thee the Lye last Night\\n\\n   Port. That it did, Sir, i'the very Throat on me: but I\\nrequited him for his Lye, and (I thinke) being too strong\\nfor him, though he tooke vp my Legges sometime, yet I\\nmade a Shift to cast him.\\nEnter Macbeth.\\n\\n  Macd.

Thou art too like the Spirit of Banquo: Down:\\nThy Crowne do's seare mine Eye-bals. And thy haire\\nThou other Gold-bound-brow, is like the first:\\nA third, is like the former. Filthy Hagges,\\nWhy do you shew me this? - A fourth? Start eyes!\\nWhat will the Line stretch out to'th' cracke of Doome?\\nAnother yet? A seauenth? Ile see no more:\\nAnd yet the eighth appeares, who beares a glasse,\\nWhich shewes me many more: and some I see,\\nThat two-fold Balles, and trebble Scepters carry.\\nHorrible sight: Now I see 'tis true,\\nFor the Blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles vpon me,\\nAnd points at them for his. What? is this so?\\n  1 I Sir, all this is so. But why\\nStands Macbeth thus amazedly?\\nCome Sisters, cheere we vp his sprights,\\nAnd shew the best of our delights.\\nIle Charme the Ayre to giue a sound,\\nWhile you performe your Antique round:\\nThat this great King may kindly say,\\nOur duties, did his welcome pay.\\n\\nMusicke.

From this moment,\\nThe very firstlings of my heart shall be\\nThe firstlings of my hand. And euen now\\nTo Crown my thoughts with Acts: be it thoght & done:\\nThe Castle of Macduff, I will surprize.\\nSeize vpon Fife; giue to th' edge o'th' Sword\\nHis Wife, his Babes, and all vnfortunate Soules\\nThat trace him in his Line. No boasting like a Foole,\\nThis deed Ile do, before this purpose coole,\\nBut no more sights. Where are these Gentlemen?\\nCome bring me where they are.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nScena Secunda.\\n\\nEnter Macduffes Wife, her Son, and Rosse.\\n\\n  Wife. What had he done, to make him fly the Land?\\n  Rosse. You must haue patience Madam\\n\\n   Wife. He had none:\\nHis flight was madnesse: when our Actions do not,\\nOur feares do make vs Traitors\\n\\n   Rosse. You know not\\nWhether it was his wisedome, or his feare\\n\\n   Wife. Wisedom? to leaue his wife, to leaue his Babes,\\nHis Mansion, and his Titles, in a place\\nFrom whence himselfe do's flye? He loues vs not,\\nHe wants the naturall touch. For the poore Wren\\n(The most diminitiue of Birds) will fight,\\nHer yong ones in her Nest, against the Owle:\\nAll is the Feare, and nothing is the Loue;\\nAs little is the Wisedome, where the flight\\nSo runnes against all reason\\n\\n   Rosse. My deerest Cooz,\\nI pray you schoole your selfe. But for your Husband,\\nHe is Noble, Wise, Iudicious, and best knowes\\nThe fits o'th' Season. I dare not speake much further,\\nBut cruell are the times, when we are Traitors\\nAnd do not know our selues: when we hold Rumor\\nFrom what we feare, yet know not what we feare,\\nBut floate vpon a wilde and violent Sea\\nEach way, and moue. I take my leaue of you:\\nShall not be long but Ile be heere againe:\\nThings at the worst will cease, or else climbe vpward,\\nTo what they were before.

With what I get I meane, and so do they\\n\\n   Wife. Poore Bird,\\nThou'dst neuer Feare the Net, nor Lime,\\nThe Pitfall, nor the Gin\\n\\n   Son.

Nay how will you do for a Husband?\\n  Wife. Why I can buy me twenty at any Market\\n\\n   Son. Then you'l by 'em to sell againe\\n\\n   Wife. Thou speak'st withall thy wit,\\nAnd yet I'faith with wit enough for thee\\n\\n   Son. Was my Father a Traitor, Mother?\\n  Wife. I, that he was\\n\\n   Son. What is a Traitor?\\n  Wife. Why one that sweares, and lyes\\n\\n   Son. And be all Traitors, that do so\\n\\n   Wife. Euery one that do's so, is a Traitor,\\nAnd must be hang'd\\n\\n   Son. And must they all be hang'd, that swear and lye?\\n  Wife. Euery one\\n\\n   Son. Who must hang them?\\n  Wife. Why, the honest men\\n\\n   Son. Then the Liars and Swearers are Fools: for there\\nare Lyars and Swearers enow, to beate the honest men,\\nand hang vp them\\n\\n   Wife. Now God helpe thee, poore Monkie:\\nBut how wilt thou do for a Father?\\n  Son. If he were dead, youl'd weepe for him: if you\\nwould not, it were a good signe, that I should quickely\\nhaue a new Father\\n\\n   Wife. Poore pratler, how thou talk'st?\\nEnter a Messenger.\\n\\n  Mes. Blesse you faire Dame: I am not to you known,\\nThough in your state of Honor I am perfect;\\nI doubt some danger do's approach you neerely.\\nIf you will take a homely mans aduice,\\nBe not found heere: Hence with your little ones\\nTo fright you thus. Me thinkes I am too sauage:\\nTo do worse to you, were fell Cruelty,\\nWhich is too nie your person. Heauen preserue you,\\nI dare abide no longer.\\n\\nExit Messenger\\n\\n  Wife. Whether should I flye?\\nI haue done no harme. But I remember now\\nI am in this earthly world: where to do harme\\nIs often laudable, to do good sometime\\nAccounted dangerous folly. Why then (alas)\\nDo I put vp that womanly defence,\\nTo say I haue done no harme?\\nWhat are these faces?\\nEnter Murtherers.\\n\\n  Mur. Where is your Husband?\\n  Wife. I hope in no place so vnsanctified,\\nWhere such as thou may'st finde him\\n\\n   Mur. He's a Traitor\\n\\n   Son. Thou ly'st thou shagge-ear'd Villaine\\n\\n   Mur. What you Egge?\\nYong fry of Treachery?\\n  Son. He ha's kill'd me Mother,\\nRun away I pray you.\\n\\nExit crying Murther.\\n\\n\\nScaena Tertia.\\n\\nEnter Malcolme and Macduffe.\\n\\n  Mal. Let vs seeke out some desolate shade, & there\\nWeepe our sad bosomes empty\\n\\n   Macd. Let vs rather\\nHold fast the mortall Sword: and like good men,\\nBestride our downfall Birthdome: each new Morne,\\nNew Widdowes howle, new Orphans cry, new sorowes\\nStrike heauen on the face, that it resounds\\nAs if it felt with Scotland, and yell'd out\\nLike Syllable of Dolour\\n\\n   Mal. What I beleeue, Ile waile;\\nWhat know, beleeue; and what I can redresse,\\nAs I shall finde the time to friend: I wil.\\nWhat you haue spoke, it may be so perchance.\\nThis Tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,\\nWas once thought honest: you haue lou'd him well,\\nHe hath not touch'd you yet. I am yong, but something\\nYou may discerne of him through me, and wisedome\\nTo offer vp a weake, poore innocent Lambe\\nT' appease an angry God\\n\\n   Macd. I am not treacherous\\n\\n   Malc. But Macbeth is.\\nA good and vertuous Nature may recoyle\\nIn an Imperiall charge. But I shall craue your pardon:\\nThat which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose;\\nAngels are bright still, though the brightest fell.\\nThough all things foule, would wear the brows of grace\\nYet Grace must still looke so\\n\\n   Macd. I haue lost my Hopes\\n\\n   Malc. Perchance euen there\\nWhere I did finde my doubts.\\nWhy in that rawnesse left you Wife, and Childe?\\nThose precious Motiues, those strong knots of Loue,\\nWithout leaue-taking. I pray you,\\nLet not my Iealousies, be your Dishonors,\\nBut mine owne Safeties: you may be rightly iust,\\nWhat euer I shall thinke\\n\\n   Macd. Bleed, bleed poore Country,\\nGreat Tyrrany, lay thou thy basis sure,\\nFor goodnesse dare not check thee: wear y thy wrongs,\\nThe Title, is affear'd. Far thee well Lord,\\nI would not be the Villaine that thou think'st,\\nFor the whole Space that's in the Tyrants Graspe,\\nAnd the rich East to boot\\n\\n   Mal. Be not offended:\\nI speake not as in absolute feare of you:\\nI thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake,\\nIt weepes, it bleeds, and each new day a gash\\nIs added to her wounds. I thinke withall,\\nThere would be hands vplifted in my right:\\nAnd heere from gracious England haue I offer\\nOf goodly thousands. But for all this,\\nWhen I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head,\\nOr weare it on my Sword; yet my poore Country\\nShall haue more vices then it had before,\\nMore suffer, and more sundry wayes then euer,\\nBy him that shall succeede\\n\\n   Macd. What should he be?\\n  Mal. It is my selfe I meane: in whom I know\\nAll the particulars of Vice so grafted,\\nThat when they shall be open'd, blacke Macbeth\\nWill seeme as pure as Snow, and the poore State\\nEsteeme him as a Lambe, being compar'd\\nWith my confinelesse harmes\\n\\n   Macd. Not in the Legions\\nOf horrid Hell, can come a Diuell more damn'd\\nIn euils, to top Macbeth\\n\\n   Mal. I grant him Bloody,\\nLuxurious, Auaricious, False, Deceitfull,\\nSodaine, Malicious, smacking of euery sinne\\nThat ha's a name. But there's no bottome, none\\nIn my Voluptuousnesse: Your Wiues, your Daughters,\\nYour Matrons, and your Maides, could not fill vp\\nThe Cesterne of my Lust, and my Desire\\nAll continent Impediments would ore-beare\\nThat did oppose my will. Better Macbeth,\\nThen such an one to reigne\\n\\n   Macd. Boundlesse intemperance\\nIn Nature is a Tyranny: It hath beene\\nTh' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne,\\nAnd fall of many Kings. But feare not yet\\nTo take vpon you what is yours: you may\\nConuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,\\nAnd yet seeme cold. The time you may so hoodwinke:\\nWe haue willing Dames enough: there cannot be\\nThat Vulture in you, to deuoure so many\\nAs will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues,\\nFinding it so inclinde\\n\\n   Mal. With this, there growes\\nIn my most ill-composd Affection, such\\nA stanchlesse Auarice, that were I King,\\nI should cut off the Nobles for their Lands,\\nDesire his Iewels, and this others House,\\nAnd my more-hauing, would be as a Sawce\\nTo make me hunger more, that I should forge\\nQuarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall,\\nDestroying them for wealth\\n\\n   Macd. This Auarice\\nstickes deeper: growes with more pernicious roote\\nThen Summer-seeming Lust: and it hath bin\\nThe Sword of our slaine Kings: yet do not feare,\\nScotland hath Foysons, to fill vp your will\\nOf your meere Owne. All these are portable,\\nWith other Graces weigh'd\\n\\n   Mal. But I haue none. The King-becoming Graces,\\nAs Iustice, Verity, Temp'rance, Stablenesse,\\nBounty, Perseuerance, Mercy, Lowlinesse,\\nDeuotion, Patience, Courage, Fortitude,\\nI haue no rellish of them, but abound\\nIn the diuision of each seuerall Crime,\\nActing it many wayes. Nay, had I powre, I should\\nPoure the sweet Milke of Concord, into Hell,\\nVprore the vniuersall peace, confound\\nAll vnity on earth\\n\\n   Macd. O Scotland, Scotland\\n\\n   Mal. If such a one be fit to gouerne, speake:\\nI am as I haue spoken\\n\\n   Mac. Fit to gouern? No not to liue. O Natio[n] miserable!\\nWith an vntitled Tyrant, bloody Sceptred,\\nWhen shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe?\\nSince that the truest Issue of thy Throne\\nBy his owne Interdiction stands accust,\\nAnd do's blaspheme his breed? Thy Royall Father\\nWas a most Sainted-King: the Queene that bore thee,\\nOftner vpon her knees, then on her feet,\\nDy'de euery day she liu'd. Fare thee well,\\nThese Euils thou repeat'st vpon thy selfe,\\nHath banish'd me from Scotland. O my Brest,\\nThy hope ends heere\\n\\n   Mal. Macduff, this Noble passion\\nChilde of integrity, hath from my soule\\nWip'd the blacke Scruples, reconcil'd my thoughts\\nTo thy good Truth, and Honor. Diuellish Macbeth,\\nBy many of these traines, hath sought to win me\\nInto his power: and modest Wisedome pluckes me\\nFrom ouer-credulous hast: but God aboue\\nDeale betweene thee and me; For euen now\\nI put my selfe to thy Direction, and\\nVnspeake mine owne detraction. Heere abiure\\nThe taints, and blames I laide vpon my selfe,\\nFor strangers to my Nature. I am yet\\nVnknowne to Woman, neuer was forsworne,\\nScarsely haue coueted what was mine owne.\\nAt no time broke my Faith, would not betray\\nThe Deuill to his Fellow, and delight\\nNo lesse in truth then life. My first false speaking\\nWas this vpon my selfe. What I am truly\\nIs thine, and my poore Countries to command:\\nWhither indeed, before they heere approach\\nOld Seyward with ten thousand warlike men\\nAlready at a point, was setting foorth:\\nNow wee'l together, and the chance of goodnesse\\nBe like our warranted Quarrell. Why are you silent?\\n  Macd. Such welcome, and vnwelcom things at once\\n'Tis hard to reconcile.\\nEnter a Doctor.\\n\\n  Mal. Well, more anon. Comes the King forth\\nI pray you?\\n  Doct.

With this strange vertue,\\nHe hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie,\\nAnd sundry Blessings hang about his Throne,\\nThat speake him full of Grace.\\nEnter Rosse.\\n\\n  Macd. See who comes heere\\n\\n   Malc. My Countryman: but yet I know him not\\n\\n   Macd. My euer gentle Cozen, welcome hither\\n\\n   Malc. I know him now. Good God betimes remoue\\nThe meanes that makes vs Strangers\\n\\n   Rosse. Sir, Amen\\n\\n   Macd. Stands Scotland where it did?\\n  Rosse. Alas poore Countrey,\\nAlmost affraid to know it selfe. It cannot\\nBe call'd our Mother, but our Graue; where nothing\\nBut who knowes nothing, is once seene to smile:\\nWhere sighes, and groanes, and shrieks that rent the ayre\\nAre made, not mark'd: Where violent sorrow seemes\\nA Moderne extasie: The Deadmans knell,\\nIs there scarse ask'd for who, and good mens liues\\nExpire before the Flowers in their Caps,\\nDying, or ere they sicken\\n\\n   Macd. Oh Relation; too nice, and yet too true\\n\\n   Malc. What's the newest griefe?\\n  Rosse. That of an houres age, doth hisse the speaker,\\nEach minute teemes a new one\\n\\n   Macd.

No, they were wel at peace, when I did leaue 'em\\n  Macd. Be not a niggard of your speech: How gos't?\\n  Rosse. When I came hither to transport the Tydings\\nWhich I haue heauily borne, there ran a Rumour\\nOf many worthy Fellowes, that were out,\\nWhich was to my beleefe witnest the rather,\\nFor that I saw the Tyrants Power a-foot.\\nNow is the time of helpe: your eye in Scotland\\nWould create Soldiours, make our women fight,\\nTo doffe their dire distresses\\n\\n   Malc. Bee't their comfort\\nWe are comming thither: Gracious England hath\\nLent vs good Seyward, and ten thousand men,\\nAn older, and a better Souldier, none\\nThat Christendome giues out\\n\\n   Rosse. Would I could answer\\nThis comfort with the like. But I haue words\\nThat would be howl'd out in the desert ayre,\\nWhere hearing should not latch them\\n\\n   Macd. What concerne they,\\nThe generall cause, or is it a Fee-griefe\\nDue to some single brest?\\n  Rosse. No minde that's honest\\nBut in it shares some woe, though the maine part\\nPertaines to you alone\\n\\n   Macd. If it be mine\\nKeepe it not from me, quickly let me haue it\\n\\n   Rosse. Let not your eares dispise my tongue for euer,\\nWhich shall possesse them with the heauiest sound\\nthat euer yet they heard\\n\\n   Macd. Humh: I guesse at it\\n\\n   Rosse. Your Castle is surpriz'd: your Wife, and Babes\\nSauagely slaughter'd: To relate the manner\\nWere on the Quarry of these murther'd Deere\\nTo adde the death of you\\n\\n   Malc. Mercifull Heauen:\\nWhat man, ne're pull your hat vpon your browes:\\nGiue sorrow words; the griefe that do's not speake,\\nWhispers the o're-fraught heart, and bids it breake\\n\\n   Macd.

This way my Lord, the Castles gently rendred:\\nThe Tyrants people, on both sides do fight,\\nThe Noble Thanes do brauely in the Warre,\\nThe day almost it selfe professes yours,\\nAnd little is to do\\n\\n   Malc.

Why should I play the Roman Foole, and dye\\nOn mine owne sword? whiles I see liues, the gashes\\nDo better vpon them.\\nEnter Macduffe.\\n\\n  Macd. Turne Hell-hound, turne\\n\\n   Macb. Of all men else I haue auoyded thee:\\nBut get thee backe, my soule is too much charg'd\\nWith blood of thine already\\n\\n   Macd.

Dispaire thy Charme,\\nAnd let the Angell whom thou still hast seru'd\\nTell thee, Macduffe was from his Mothers womb\\nVntimely ript\\n\\n   Macb. Accursed be that tongue that tels mee so;\\nFor it hath Cow'd my better part of man:\\nAnd be these Iugling Fiends no more beleeu'd,\\nThat palter with vs in a double sence,\\nThat keepe the word of promise to our eare,\\nAnd breake it to our hope.

Hee's worth more sorrow,\\nand that Ile spend for him\\n\\n   Sey. He's worth no more,\\nThey say he parted well, and paid his score,\\nAnd so God be with him. Here comes newer comfort.\\nEnter Macduffe, with Macbeths head.\\n\\n  Macd. Haile King, for so thou art.\\nBehold where stands\\nTh' Vsurpers cursed head: the time is free:\\nI see thee compast with thy Kingdomes Pearle,\\nThat speake my salutation in their minds:\\nWhose voyces I desire alowd with mine.\\nHaile King of Scotland\\n\\n   All.
